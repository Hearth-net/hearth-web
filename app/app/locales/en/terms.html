          <ol>
            <li><p>At our Site you can create and use only one user account. If you stop using or cancel this account, you will not create another account without our prior written consent.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can only register (create an account), as an individual (not as an organization or group) under your civil name and with a profile photo which corresponds to your current appearance. It is not possible to register under a nickname or under an alias, use photos of other people, caricatures, avatars, etc.. This condition does not apply to creation of a community, a community is not considered to be creation of an account.</p></li>
            <li><p>You will not allow any other person to use your account, or disclose the password to your account to another person.</p></li>
            <li>

              <p>It is permissable to present yourself in your profile as a businessman donating their services without any other related conditions. But it is not permissable to indicate in your profile a range of other products for a fee, set conditions on the provision of free services subject to paid services, offer discounts on products, etc.</p>
              <p>It is similarly not permissable to offer services with the aim of convincing another user of the benefits of participation in subsequent financial and commercial transactions: for example, financial advice, insurance consultation, free trips with business presentations, various “educational events” of MLM systems and their distributed products, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>You will not use your account to present a range of services and goods whose implementation is unlawful and / or services and things that are in significant conflict with generally accepted ethical and moral rules (this applies for example to the supply of illicit drugs, reproducing copyrighted works, intentionally shocking content, etc.).</p></li>
            <li><p>You acknowledge that the site is part of the public Internet and that it is not within our capacity to prevent the contents recorded in your account to get out of the Site (such as screenshots of the screen made by another user). You should therefore record on the Site only content for which you do not mind this condition.</p></li>
            <li><p>You must be at least 15 years of age.</p></li>
            <li><p>For any content which you upload to the Site, you must have copyright, or where applicable respect any license which applies to the recorded content.</p></li>

              <p>A requirement for the supply of input material or the creation of favourable conditions for the provision of services to take place, is not a demand for a consideration.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>You may not copy by machine or otherwise any content of the Site or parts thereof (images, text, video, etc.). Exception is granted in the case of content that is labeled with a license that allows you to copy.</p></li>
