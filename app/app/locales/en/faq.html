<p class="q">
	I registered and haven’t received the confirmation e-mail. What should I do?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		As the first step, check your mailbox properly, particularly the spam box, because it’s possible that the authorization request was unfortunately considered by your computer to be SPAM.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are unable to find the authorization e-mail in your mailbox at all, inform us at <a href="mailto:support@hearth.net">support@hearth.net</a>, preferably from the e-mail address that you registered on Hearth.net.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	I’m registered and here for the first time. What should I do?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		The best way is to start with your own profile. Please fill in all the relevant information that you want to share about yourself, it’s well worth adding a photo in which you are recognizable, as it not only makes your profile more attractive to other users, but also makes any future meetings for handing over gifts easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		After that it’s easy, you can click on “Market” in the upper bar of the orange menu and take a look at the gifts or wishes of other users. We highly recommend trying the blue bar with the filter function, or looking at the map to see what is (not) happening in your area. Or you can “Add a new gift or wish” right away, by clicking on the blue bar in the right upper corner of the “Market”.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the “About” section you can read the blog and our feeds on other social networks, find our contact details and the conditions of use.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is just the start, the other functions you can most certainly discover by yourself. If you can’t, or if there is something that doesn’t work according to your wishes, inform us about it at <a href="mailto:support@hearth.net">support@hearth.net</a>.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	I have changed my e-mail address, how can I change it in my profile or when signing in?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		The e-mail used during registration can only be changed by an administrator at present. Please send any request for a change of e-mail address to <a href="mailto:support@hearth.net">support@hearth.net</a> and our colleagues from IT will contact you.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	How do I evaluate on Hearth.net?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		Evaluating users is possible in their profile by clicking on the “coloured strip” (usually green, but also grey, if there has been no evaluation yet) next to the profile picture or orange avatar icon. Then you will see the blue button saying “Thank you!”.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	I made a mistake and gave the wrong evaluation, how can I change it?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		Changes to evaluations can only be done only an administrator. If you had rebuked someone by mistake and now want to praise them, or vice versa, you can write the right evaluation on the profile in the right way and ask for the removal of your wrong evaluation via <a href="mailto:support@hearth.net">support@hearth.net</a>
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	I’m a newcomer here so I’d like some advice – is it possible to put my website into my profile here or would it be understood as an advertisement?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		You can put into your profile anything that you find suitable, possible, right, characterizing...
	</p>
	<p>
		Concerns about advertisement are justified (some of our users have eagle eyes), but in this respect we devote the biggest attention to the behavior individuals when offering or asking for gifts/services. It means that when you as an “entrepreneur” act as a genuine donor or recipient on Hearth.net, we don’t have any objections to you sharing your enterprise.
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, if anybody (whose business is not mentioned in the profile) offers a gift against payment or recommends some service, albeit with a discount, we enter the process to request rephrasing or withdrawal of the offer.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	What to do if people have reacted to some of the gifts that I have posted – according to the enclosed notice about the number of offers below the advertisement – but I haven’t received their reaction?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		If you haven’t received any reaction to your e-mail, you can find all the requests either in Messages or in the details of your advertisement, where you can find the e-mail address of the person that approached you.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	I was asked for the gift by more people, how can I choose whom to give it to?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		It’s totally up to you. Every Hearth member has completely different criteria of choice and decision-making and that is right. Some give to other people according to their merits (they track their profiles, if they have ever given something to somebody and how many times, or if they have positive evaluation and whom from), others choose according to the saying “first come, first served”, some people’s criteria is face-to-face handover, because they want to see the smile of the recipient.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only universal “regulation” is that the giving must be joyful. It means, choose and give your gift to those you are glad will receive a gift from you. Sending a rejection response to the other users is not a duty, but we think that it is kind and polite, and those are characteristics we should cultivate :-)
	</p>
</div>
<p class="q">
	Does it make sense to react to an offer or request, when I can see that someone has already reacted?
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
		It definitely makes sense. You never know according to which criteria the donor or recipient makes their choice. It sometimes happens that a gift is offered to more people (a harvest from the garden). It may also happen, that the agreement with the first respondent didn’t go well and then it’s no problem, they don’t have to issue the advertisement again and can just react to the other answers in sequence – this may mean yours. You never know, YOU could be the one, for whom the donor or recipient is actually waiting, because the arrangement and giving can be joyful and funny only with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, you should react to offers you are really interested in or, on the other hand, when you want to offer something that someone needs. The number of reactions before does not determine what happens after. It’s purely for information.
