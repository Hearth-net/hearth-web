		<h5 class="subheader">It's a big joy to give gifts! To make it easier for you to get started, we have crafted these practical 
			principles from the experience of Hearth.net community with gifting over several years.</h5>
			<br>
		<h4>Everyday Gifting</h4>
		<p>
			You can give gifts every day, not just on holidays and birthdays. Gifting brings joy, 
			opportunity to meet great people and is kind to our planet. Yes, you can give things... and 
			also help with your time, advice and wisdom.
		</p>

		<h4>Unconditionality</h4>
		<p>
			For a gift, nothing in return is expected. Being open to receiving is a gift in itself. You can
			express gratitude by thanking and smiling. The person who gives will enjoy it.
		</p>

		<h4>Value</h4>
		<p>
			Offer only what will really help or please someone. Very few people want to receive broken or useless things.
		</p>

		<h4>Freedom of Decision</h4>
		<p>
			Generosity should make us happy. You can choose to give or receive only what you want and 
			with who you want. If something doesn't feel right, just say no thank you.
		</p>

		<h4>Fair Play</h4>
		<p class="bigger">
			Try to describe exactly what it is you offer or wish for, and where you prefer to meet. 
			Communicate clearly and arrive on time.
		</p>

		<h4>Story</h4>
		<p>
			Telling our stories brings us closer together. The person who gives will probably appreciate it, 
			if you tell them how the gift will help you and how you later enjoyed it.
		</p>

		<h4>Personal Meeting</h4>
		<p>
			Exchanging our gifts in person makes it more than just a transaction. Shake hands, greet each other,
			share a smile and have a cup of coffee. You may get to know great friends this way.
		</p>

		<h4>Pay it Forward</h4>
		<p>
			If you enjoyed receiving a gift, consider passing on that great feeling. Give gifts every day, it will make people happy.
