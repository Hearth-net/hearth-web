		<h4>It`s easy</h4>
		<p>
			You can give gifts every day, not just on holidays and birthdays. Gifting brings joy, opportunity to meet great 
			friends and is kind to our planet. Yes, you can give things... but also share and help with your time, advice, 
			knowledge and wisdom.
		</p>

		<h4>Unconditionality</h4>
		<p>
			For a gift, nothing in return is expected. Being open to receiving is a gift in itself. You can express 
			gratitude by thanking and smiling. The person who gives will enjoy it.
		</p>

		<h4>Value</h4>
		<p>
			Offer only what will really help or please someone. Very few people want to receive broken or useless things.
		</p>

		<h4>Freedom of decision</h4>
		<p>
			Generosity should make us happy. You can choose to give or receive only what you want and with who you want.
			If something doesn't feel right, just say no thank you.
		</p>

		<h4>Correctness</h4>
		<p>
			Try to describe exactly what it is you offer or wish for, and where you prefer to meet. Communicate clearly and 
			arrive on time, especially if you are the person receiving the gift.
		</p>

		<h4>Story</h4>
		<p>
			Telling our stories brings us closer together. The person who gives will probably appreciate it, if they 
			understand how the gift will help you and how you later enjoyed it.
		</p>

		<h4>Meet and smile</h4>
		<p>
			Exchanging our gifts in person makes it more than just a transaction. Shake hands, greet each other, share 
			a smile and connect. Maybe you'll get to know a great friend.
		</p>

		<h4>Pay it forward</h4>
		<p>
			If you enjoyed receiving a gift, consider passing on that great feeling. You won't believe the smile on your 
			face when you see how happy your gift makes someone else.
		</p>
