Testing with Protractor
-----------------------
For end2end testing we use Protractor tool which is build on top of selenium. 

### Setup

Use npm to install all dependencies together with protractor and webdriver-manager tools which are needed for end2end testing.
```
cd web/app
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update
```

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running.

### Run tests

Run frontend app first:
```
npm start
```

Then you can run all tests using:
```
npm test
```

Or pick only one test suite from suite list in web/app/protractor.js file, eg.:
```
npm test -- --suite=unauth
```

Testing with Karma
------------------
### Run tests
Run the tests from the web/app directory.
```
karma start
```
It will search for the karma.spec.js in the current directory.
If you want to specify the config file, run
```
karma start xxx.spec.js
```

### Structure and important files location
* /app/karma.conf.js - configuration file
* /app/test/spec/setup.js - additional setup for the test environment
* /app/test/spec - root directory for tests

### Examples
* app/test/spec/assets/components/avatar/avatar.spec.js -  setup of the directive test
